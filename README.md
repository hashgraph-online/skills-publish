# skill-publish

`skill-publish` is a GitHub Action that publishes **trustless, immutable, on-chain** skill releases and returns canonical references you can pin, verify, and re-fetch later.

Instead of sharing mutable URLs or copy/paste blobs, each `name@version` release is recorded on Hedera (HCS) and exposed via `hcs://...` references. That immutability is the value: the published artifact is tamper-evident, reproducible, and audit-friendly.

Immutability gives you:

- **Version pinning:** consumers can depend on an exact `name@version`.
- **Reproducible retrieval:** the same canonical references resolve later (not “whatever is at this URL today”).
- **Audit trail:** topic IDs, job IDs, and optional repo+commit stamping connect releases back to source.

A skill package is `SKILL.md` + `skill.json` (plus optional files). The action validates, quotes, publishes, waits for completion, and emits outputs.

## CLI (npx)

The CLI now supports guided, Vercel-style command discovery:

```bash
npx skill-publish
npx skill-publish --help
```

Core flows:

```bash
npx skill-publish setup --account-id 0.0.12345 --hedera-private-key <key> --hbar 5
npx skill-publish init ./skills/my-skill
npx skill-publish doctor ./skills/my-skill
npx skill-publish validate ./skills/my-skill
RB_API_KEY=rbk_xxx npx skill-publish quote ./skills/my-skill
RB_API_KEY=rbk_xxx npx skill-publish publish ./skills/my-skill
```

Repository automation flows:

```bash
# Add a publish workflow to an existing SKILL.md repository
npx skill-publish setup-action . --skill-dir skills/my-skill

# Scaffold a new repository with skill package + GitHub workflow preconfigured
npx skill-publish scaffold-repo ./weather-skill --name weather-skill
```

Wallet-first bootstrap:

```bash
# Create API key via ledger challenge/verify and top up credits in one command
npx skill-publish setup \
  --account-id 0.0.12345 \
  --network hedera:testnet \
  --hedera-private-key <key> \
  --hbar 5
```

What `setup` does:
- requests a ledger challenge from the broker
- signs locally with your Hedera private key
- verifies the challenge and receives an API key
- stores the key in `~/.skill-publish/credentials.json` (unless `--no-save`)
- optionally purchases credits with `--hbar`

After setup, `quote` and `publish` automatically reuse the stored key, so you can run:

```bash
npx skill-publish doctor ./skills/my-skill
npx skill-publish quote ./skills/my-skill
npx skill-publish publish ./skills/my-skill
```

`publish` remains the default command, so legacy flag-only usage still works:

```bash
RB_API_KEY=rbk_xxx npx skill-publish --skill-dir ./skills/my-skill
```

Optional overrides:

```bash
npx skill-publish \
  publish \
  --api-key rbk_xxx \
  --skill-dir ./skills/my-skill \
  --version 1.2.3 \
  --annotate false
```

Dry run behavior:

```bash
npx skill-publish publish ./skills/my-skill --dry-run
# no key => validate-only
# with key => quote-only
```

## First Publish in Under 5 Minutes

1. Generate an API key: https://hol.org/registry/docs?tab=api-keys
2. Add credits: https://hol.org/registry/docs?tab=credits
3. Add `RB_API_KEY` as a GitHub secret.
4. Commit `SKILL.md` and `skill.json` to your repo.
5. Add this workflow and publish a release.

```yaml
name: Publish Skill
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Publish skill package
        uses: hashgraph-online/skill-publish@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.RB_API_KEY }}
          skill-dir: skills/my-skill
          annotate: "true"
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
```

Expected success signal:
- workflow output includes `published=true`
- output includes `skill-json-hrl` (`hcs://...`) for your immutable release reference

## Minimal Skill Package

```
skills/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── skill.json
```

Example `skill.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-skill",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Example skill package"
}
```

## Golden Workflow Templates

Use these copy-ready templates:

- Release-driven publish: `examples/workflows/publish-on-release.yml`
- Manual publish (`workflow_dispatch`): `examples/workflows/publish-manual.yml`
- Monorepo path-filtered publish: `examples/workflows/publish-monorepo-paths.yml`

## Why This Matters (Trustless Skills)

Most “skills” get shared as copy/paste blobs or mutable links. That works until you need version pinning, audits, or reproducibility.

In this context, a “trustless skill release” means:

- you publish an exact `name@version`
- consumers can later re-fetch the same published artifact by its canonical reference
- you can compare versions over time without relying on a private server or a package registry
- the published payload can be traced back to a repo + commit (default behavior)

This action exists to make that publish step deterministic and automated in CI.

## What You Provide vs What Runs in CI

| You provide | Action handles |
| --- | --- |
| `skill-dir` with `SKILL.md` and `skill.json` | file discovery, MIME detection, size checks |
| `RB_API_KEY` secret | authenticated API calls |
| optional overrides (`name`, `version`) | payload shaping and metadata stamping |
| optional annotation settings | release/PR annotation behavior |
| workflow trigger | quote/publish/job polling orchestration |

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api-key` | Yes | - | Registry Broker API key. |
| `skill-dir` | Yes | - | Path containing `SKILL.md` and `skill.json`. |
| `api-base-url` | No | `https://hol.org/registry/api/v1` | Broker base URL (`.../registry` or `.../registry/api/v1`). |
| `account-id` | No | - | Optional Hedera account ID for publish authorization edge cases. |
| `name` | No | - | Optional skill name override for `skill.json`. |
| `version` | No | - | Optional version override for `skill.json`. |
| `stamp-repo-commit` | No | `true` | Stamp `repo` and `commit` metadata into payload. |
| `poll-timeout-ms` | No | `720000` | Max time to wait for publish job completion. |
| `poll-interval-ms` | No | `4000` | Interval between publish job status polls. |
| `annotate` | No | `true` | Post publish result to release notes or merged PR comments. |
| `github-token` | No | - | Token used only when `annotate=true`. |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `published` | `true` when publish executed, `false` when skipped. |
| `skip-reason` | Skip reason (currently `version-exists`). |
| `skill-name` | Skill name from publish result. |
| `skill-version` | Skill version from publish result. |
| `quote-id` | Broker quote identifier. |
| `job-id` | Publish job identifier. |
| `directory-topic-id` | Skill directory topic ID. |
| `package-topic-id` | Skill package topic ID. |
| `skill-json-hrl` | Canonical `hcs://...` reference for `skill.json`. |
| `credits` | Credits consumed. |
| `estimated-cost-hbar` | Estimated HBAR cost from quote. |
| `annotation-target` | Annotation destination (`release:<id>`, `pr:<id>`, `none`, `failed`). |
| `result-json` | Full result payload as JSON string. |

Useful references after publish:
- `directory-topic-id`: where the skill record lives
- `package-topic-id`: package/version topic reference
- `skill-json-hrl`: canonical reference you can paste into docs, release notes, or tooling

An HRL looks like: `hcs://1/0.0.12345`

## Example: Gate Follow-up Jobs on Publish State

```yaml
- name: Publish skill
  id: publish_skill
  uses: hashgraph-online/skill-publish@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.RB_API_KEY }}
    skill-dir: skills/my-skill

- name: Notify only when new version published
  if: steps.publish_skill.outputs.published == 'true'
  run: |
    echo "Published ${{
      steps.publish_skill.outputs.skill-name
    }}@${{
      steps.publish_skill.outputs.skill-version
    }}"
```

## Runtime Behavior

1. Discovers and validates package files in `skill-dir`.
2. Resolves broker limits from `/skills/config`.
3. Checks if `name@version` already exists.
4. Requests quote via `POST /skills/quote`.
5. Publishes via `POST /skills/publish`.
6. Polls `GET /skills/jobs/{jobId}` until completion.
7. Emits outputs, step summary, and optional GitHub annotations.

## Idempotency and Failure Behavior

- If `name@version` already exists, the action exits cleanly with `published=false` and `skip-reason=version-exists`.
- Publish failures return structured output in `result-json` so CI can gate follow-up jobs.
- Annotation failures do not hide publish status; `annotation-target` reports where comments were attempted.

## Trust and Security Defaults

- Recommended minimum permissions are `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, and `issues: write`.
- Store `RB_API_KEY` in repository or organization secrets.
- If you do not need GitHub annotations, set `annotate: "false"` and omit `github-token`.
- For strict supply-chain pinning, pin to a full commit SHA instead of `@v1`:

```yaml
uses: hashgraph-online/skill-publish@93aee116a8a4b8d90dcde8cfb64628bc255becde
```

- When annotations are disabled, this tighter permission set is sufficient:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

## Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skip-reason=version-exists` | Same `name@version` already published | Bump `version` in `skill.json` and re-run. |
| Quote request fails | Missing credits or invalid package metadata | Top up credits, then validate `skill.json` fields and size limits. |
| Publish job times out | Broker load or long queue | Increase `poll-timeout-ms` (for example, `1200000`) and re-run. |
| `published=true` but no PR/release annotation | Missing write scopes or missing `github-token` | Add `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`, `contents: write`, and pass `github-token`. |
| Missing file validation error | `SKILL.md` or `skill.json` not found under `skill-dir` | Verify folder structure and `skill-dir` path in workflow. |
| API authentication error | Wrong or revoked API key | Regenerate key at `/registry/docs?tab=api-keys` and update `RB_API_KEY` secret. |

## How Verification Works (HCS-26)

You do not need the full standard to use this action, but the storage and lookup rules follow HCS-26.

- the Registry Broker is the publish API surface
- the publish result includes topic IDs and `hcs://...` HRLs that can be resolved independently
